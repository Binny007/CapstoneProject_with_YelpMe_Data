Yelp me!

Hey there! Ever wondered what makes some restaurants a smashing hit while others just can't seem to get the recipe
right? Well, we're diving into the world of Yelp reviews to figure it all out. It's like detective work for foodies!

Objective:
So, what's the game plan? We're taking on a project to sift through tons of Yelp data to find out what really makes a
restaurant succeed. Think of it as going on a scavenger hunt through comments and ratings to discover the secret
sauce behind a great dining place.

We're gonna dig through customer feedback, look at different features of restaurants, and uncover what makes people
love or hate a place. It's all about finding what gets people talking and coming back for more.

By figuring all this out, restaurant owners can really step up their game. They can tweak their menus, shake up their
service, or even spruce up the d√©cor. Basically, they can learn from what people are saying on Yelp and make their
place the kind of spot everyone's raving about.

So, grab your data detective hat, and let's get to it! Together, we'll learn the ins and outs of the restaurant biz and
maybe even help make someone's favorite burger joint even better. Cool, right?
